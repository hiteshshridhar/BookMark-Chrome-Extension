# BookMark-Chrome-Extension
This project is entirely a learned Project from "Scrimba" and published on my gitHub account. 
In future I would rather change the file structure and then publish it again but till then enjoy this one. 

STEPS on HOW TO USE THE EXTENSION:

  - download the repository. 
  - Unpack the Repository in your designated Location (could be anywhere on your system). 
  - Go to chrome://extensions URL and Enable developer mode. 
  - Unpack the project in your local folder. 
  - on Chrome extension, click on load Unpacked and select the extension folder. 
  - and Walla, you have successfully enabled the extension on your system. 
  
  
WORKING OF THE EXTENSION:
  - Write anything in the input field to save it as a link. 
  - You can click on "SAVE TAB" button to fetch the current URL and this will be saved for you. 
  - DOUBLE CLICK on delete button to delete everything from your extension.
